"The Territory of Missouri’s journey to statehood was fraught with debate over the issue of slavery. The abolition movement was beginning in the north, and some northern congressman didn’t want to see slavery’s reach grown “For some of them, it was for humanitarian reasons, but for a lot of them it was really for political reasons," said historian and UMKC professor Diane Mutti-Burke. "They were concerned about the growing power of politicians from the slave states. They didn't want to see another slave state enter the union -- because of that and so they fought quite hard about it."

To preserve the balance, Congress came to the Missouri Compromise in 1820. Missouri joined the nation as a slave state, Maine as a free state, and the Missouri Compromise determined whether all other new states would be slave or free based on their location on the map.

Nineteen years later, the University of Missouri was founded, and the first leaders of the school didn't escape the debate over slavery.

John Lathrop, A Yale-educated New Yorker, was the first president of the University of Missouri. 

"He was teaching the sorts of things that might encourage students to be anti-slavery," said Joan Stack , curator of art collections for the State Historical Society of Missouri. The little card hanging next to Lathrop’s portrait in the Historical Society’s gallery reads: “Although Lathrop was not outspokenly political, he was suspected of holding anti-slavery views.” Those suspicions may have fueled tensions between Lathrop and some members of the Board of Curators that ended with Lathrop moving north to become the first Chancellor at the University of Wisconsin. He was replaced by James Shannon, an outspoken supporter of slavery who made his views very clear. It was a position that contributed to tension with the legislature and to Shannon also leaving the university.

It is clear that some early university leaders owned slaves. James Sidney Rollins, a lawyer, politician and slaveholder, is often called the father of MU, in part because he helped raise the funds to establish the campus in Columbia. He was in Congress during the Civil War, and had originally voted against the 13th Amendment, which would abolish slavery, but later, Missouri abolished slavery at the state level. A few days after, Rollins gave a rousing speech in support of the 13th Amendment.

It's a long speech, and in it Rollins wrote things that at times seem to contradict each other. He wrote that he would either support or abolish slavery - whichever maintained national unity, which was his most important goal. He wrote that although slavery was wrong, he believed it ultimately helped people. And he said he was "an anti-slavery man in sentiment, and yet, heretofore a large owner of slaves myself."

He also wrote that "the institution of African slavery" could not be defended either upon religious or moral grounds, and said, "I am no longer the owner of a slave, and I thank God for it."

# Segregation at School

After the civil war, the formerly enslaved people of Missouri were free, but not equal. The state constitution called for segregated education, which meant black students could not attend MU - but the state still had to offer them higher education. So what is now Lincoln University was established in in 1866 in Jefferson City for African Americans, but it didn't offer the same courses as MU.

Gary Kremer is director of the State Historical Society of Missouri.

"If an African American student aspired to study or take a course of instruction that was not available at Lincoln, the procedure was that they would apply to the University of Missouri, be rejected, and then take their rejection to the legislatures so that money could be appropriated to send them out of the state," he said. "Of course, it was Lloyd Gaines who challenged that system."

Lloyd Gaines went to Lincoln University, but didn't want to be sent out of state to attend law school. He wanted to go to MU, and he began a lawsuit in 1938 for admission. At that time, there were no black students at the university, and a black man had been lynched by a mob in Columbia just 15 years before.

The Supreme Court ruled that Missouri had to either admit Gaines to MU or create a separate law school for African Americans. The University chose to create a new law school, and Gaines seemed poised to continue fighting on the grounds that the new school was not equal. But his fight never reached a conclusion. Gaines was last seen in Chicago in 1939. He disappeared, and it's unknown what happened to him. Legal scholars say his case laid the groundwork for the Brown v. Board of Education ruling in 1954.

The same year Gaines disappeared, a woman applied to the MU school of journalism.

"The issue with Lucile Bluford was that she applied for admittance to the Missouri Journalism master's program and they did not know she was black until she showed up on campus to register for classes," explained MU Journalism professor and historian Earnest Perry. "Once they realized that she was black they basically said 'No, we're not going to allow you to register for classes, your admission is rescinded.' And then she took that case, or she and the NAACP, took that case to court."
This had the same result as Gaines' case: The state created a separate journalism school at Lincoln University rather than let Bluford into MU. But Perry says that while MU administration seemed immovably opposed to admitting African American students, polls by the student newspaper revealed a different attitude in the student body.

"Students overwhelmingly supported African American students being admitted to the University,” Perry said “The University officials, they acknowledged that the students wanted that but they were not going to change their policy."

Lucille Bluford's case was never fully decided. But finally, in 1950, the first African American students at MU began classes. That was 66 years ago.
