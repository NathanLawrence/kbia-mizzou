Most timelines of the events that led to the November 9th resignation of former UM system president Tim Wolfe start at the 2015 homecoming parade, when the group Concerned Student 1950 stopped Wolfe’s car and recited a history of racism in Missouri and on the Mizzou campus. Wolfe received criticism for not speaking with the students, and many believe that perceived slight made Wolfe a target.

But to understand how Tim Wolfe, the president of the entire university system, became the target of this movement, we have to turn back the clock much further, to when Wolfe was first hired.

KBIA spoke to seven of the curators who played some role in the hiring process of Tim Wolfe: in the beginning, the end, or all the way through. From those conversations, a few common themes emerged. The first: it is impossible to talk about Tim Wolfe’s hiring without first mentioning his predecessor: Gary Forsee.

## Laying the Foundation

“He was not your prototype of what historically had been viewed as president of a university system,” Don Downing, a former member of the University of Missouri System Board of Curators explained. “Gary came from a business background. He was CEO of Sprint.”

Before Gary Forsee became president of the University system, he was president and CEO of Sprint Nextel, before that, he worked for BellSouth, a telecommunications corporation, and for Cingular wireless, and for Global one, and for AT&T. In short, while he had a lot of experience, none of it was in higher education. And back in 2007, hiring a business person to run an academic institution was not as common of a practice, but some of the most pressing matters facing the University at the time of Forsee’s tenure were not inherently academic. Especially one: state funding. 

Beginning in about 2002, state appropriations for the University of Missouri system began to dip. On just the Columbia campus, student enrollment grew by 45% between 2001 and 2012, In that same time period, state funding to the University dropped by 14 percent, from 193 million dollars down to 166 million. 

There are only a few ways to make up that difference in funding. Tuition is one of them. [Here’s David Wasinger, a curator when Forsee was hired.]

"Tuition had gotten too high and we -- at least I -- wanted someone to monitor and make the university more efficient," said David Wasinger, another former curator. "A lot of the administrators and a lot of the faculty have an insatiable appetite for spending."

To the curators at the time, Gary Forsee’s business background made him sort of an ideal fit for the tough financial times facing the university system. Not everyone saw his hire in the same light, though, including Gary Ebersole, a University of Missouri kansas city professor and member of the UM System’s intercampus faculty council. 

"The hiring of Gary Forsee was a kind of out-of-the-box move by the board of trustees who decided they wanted a businessman. Faculty were not really involved not in the search itself and not enthused by the idea of a businessman."

Forsee’s tenure was not without its hiccups, but over time he seemed to win over many stakeholders including the faculty. Even Ebersole agreed the arrangement seemed to work out, saying eventually, the two of them "worked quite well together."

In Jan. 2011, less than three years into his tenure, Forsee resigned following his wife’s cancer diagnosis. Downing says the perceived success of Forsee’s tenure opened the field of possibilities in the search for his successor, but it may have been more than just that. Although every curator we spoke to said they considered all types of candidates, by most accounts, given the continued financial constraints on the University system, most curators thought it made sense to replace Forsee with another person with a business background. 

By this time, this type of hire with a business background seemed to be becoming popular nationally. Michael Bastedo is a professor at the University of Michigan specializing in higher education. 

"It definitely seems to be more common that trustees are looking for a president with a business-type background," he explained.

However, just because curators decide they’re looking for someone with a business or political background to run an academic institution, doesn’t make it an easy task to accomplish. Wasinger. The complexity of running a university system isn’t always attractive to a business person, and even if it is, many of the most successful executives at large enterprises aren't interested in making a move to the public sector.

The board hired Florida-based search firm Greenwood/Asher & Associates to track down a pool of candidates to replace Forsee, but by most accounts, the board wasn’t satisfied with the names they saw on the list. In response, the board also recruited candidates through other lines, like the business school alumni network - which is how Tim Wolfe’s name came to the applicant pool.

The curators courted Wolfe, trying to entice him to come back to his alma mater, and almost every curator we spoke with said they were consistently impressed by Wolfe's temperament and personality.

"Tim Wolfe is an outstanding individual," Craig Van Matre, who was involved in the hiring process, explained. "He has a very good personality, He is a good speaker, he is intelligent and quick, but he doesn’t have the kind of personality characteristics that are off-putting. He has two parents who were PhDs and professors at the University so he grew up with an academic background in effect in Columbia, Missouri."

Wolfe got the job and things started okay. He was a good 'ol boy who graduated from Mizzou. When the University came under scrutiny for their shortcomings related to Title IX issues, they were addressed quickly.

## Tension Mounts

Then the tide began to shift after a few unpopular decisions and silence on a few major issues. Ebersole says Wolfe’s first misstep was in 2012, deciding to close the University-operated publishing house, the University of Missouri press.

"He comes into the office, looks over budgets and sees that the university press was in the red," he explained, "and he very quickly said 'we’re not going to keep a university press that’s in the red' without understanding that there is not a single university press in the country that makes money. In other words, universities subsidize the presses because it is an absolutely essential part of the investment in education that knowledge be distributed and disseminated to the world really."

Ultimately Wolfe reversed this decision, but critics point to other decisions too -- like the expansion of sports facilities and over attentiveness to large donors at the expense of academic affairs - the institution’s bread and butter. To many of the curators, Wolfe’s biggest misstep may have been the hiring of R. Bowen Loftin as chancellor of the flagship campus in 2013. Loftin, who previously was president at Texas A&M University, says he was hired by Wolfe to shake things up.

"The curators and president Wolfe both told me I was to be an agent of change."

Loftin moved swiftly as chancellor. He held the position for not even two years, but in that time he rocked the Columbia campus boat. Under Loftin, 110 faculty and 13 administrators accepted early retirement, reportedly saving the university millions. 

"To be able to get about 10% of our senior tenured faculty to retire in one year, that's an extraordinary thing," he said. "To free up the resources required to renew our faculty in a very short period of time. that's a very rare thing for a campus to be able to do so, I’m very proud this university was able to do that."

But last year, when student aid and benefits ended up on the chopping block, things got sloppy. The University announced it would cut Graduate student tuition waivers in half, then reversed the decision. Another snafu? Health insurance subsidies for graduate students were dropped with only a one day heads up -- a decision Loftin himself eventually reversed. The damage was done, though. Large student demonstrations popped up on campus in response to these missteps, with many faculty backing them.

Then there were other high-profile decisions - cutting the vice chancellor for health affairs position, revoking hospital privileges for a planned parenthood doctor, even the resignation of the dean of the medical school was attributed to Loftin. All of these decisions drew backlash, from students, from faculty, even administrators - and most of it was directed at Loftin, but he claims in every case, he was consulting with Tim Wolfe. 

"I shared with him everything I knew here on campus that I felt was relevant," Loftin said, "and every major decision I made was discussed with him before i made it so we had a very strong relationship, I thought. Back in August of last year i had my second annual evaluation, in september sent me a letter giving me praise for my work and also indicating financial rewards along with that. So I felt - this was september of 2015 - i felt we were on good terms at that point."

Tim Wolfe did not respond to our multiple requests for an interview, but in a now infamous email published first by the Columbia Daily Tribune in January, Wolfe alluded to those decisions made by Loftin, adding that all of the deans on the Missouri campus had called for Loftin’s ouster  and that Wolfe himself had requested support from the board of curators to fire Loftin. 

This was the environment, even before Wolfe’s confrontation with Concerned Student 1950 at the homecoming parade: tension, not just about race, but about university funding and top-down decision making, all of it part of the struggle to move the University forward into the realities of the 21st century.

## The Breaking Point

Anger and tension brewed in the university of missouri system. Many students were upset that administrators didn’t respond strongly when the student body President was called a racial slur off campus in September. Then, on Oct. 5, students in the Legion of Black Collegians were called the same slur on campus. Loftin released a video condemning the incident.

Emotions boiled over. It was just a few days later that Concerned Student 1950 stopped Tim Wolfe’s car at Homecoming. 

The group issued a list of demands as Wolfe was slow to acknowledge the racial issues even after the homecoming demonstration. One of the demands was for Wolfe to be removed as President.

Jonathan Butler, a black graduate student, began a hunger strike, saying it would only end when Wolfe was out as President. The football team backed the protesters, boycotting practice and games until Butler could eat again - when Wolfe was gone. Graduate students joined in. Faculty came out stongly in support of the protests, too. 

On Nov. 9, less than a week before the university would face a $1 million fine for not participating in a football game if strike continued, the school reached its breaking point.

NEWS BITE ACT ON WOLFE MAKING ANNOUNCEMENT

Just minutes into this mornings curators meeting UM systems president Tim Wolfe approached the podium and immediately announced his resignation.

SNIPPET OF WOLFE’S RESIGNATION SPEECH

The protesters were ecstatic. But, as Craig Van Matre explains, the people who hired Wolfe were not. 

Van Matre 26ish
And then when Wolfe did the only thing that he could do and resigned, then they had this symbolic head on this symbolic stick and not one thing of any practical value came out of it from there on. Very disappointing very disappointing all the way around. 

For many of the curators who hired Wolfe, the issue of racism on the Mizzou campus was exactly that.

David Bradley

That was a campus level issue, it should have been handled at the campus level, and when it wasn’t handled at the campus level, I thought it was unfortunate that Tim fell on the sword for this issue.

I for one wish he wouldn't have resigned. I talked to him about it at the time.

I’m very sorry that happened, but that doesn’t change the fact that Tim Wolfe was an excellent leader for the University of Missouri system during his presidency  

David Wasinger

Wasinger 13:45
Now we have the remnants of a head football coach and some self-described radicals who have been running, or the perception that they have been running, the University of Missouri, and you cannot have that. 

In his confidential letter to friends that was later made public Wolfe said he was concerned about campus safety and the escalation of protests turning into something historically embarrassing for the University of Missouri. Craig Van Matre agreed.

Van Matre 27ish
Did Wolfe do the right thing by tendering his resignation? absolutely. Had he not i don't think the curators ever would have fired him. Matter of fact [chuckles] if it were possible, which i don't know if it is or not, I wish i wish he'd reapply for the job so we could rehire him. It’d make a lot more sense to re hire him than spend the thousands and thousands of dollars and thousands of horus that it takes finding his replacement.

FALLOUT

Much like the decisions that rattled the Columbia campus in the past couple years - graduate student health subsidies, refer and follow privileges for the planned parenthood doctor, the med school dean - the resignations of Wolfe and Loftin happened rapidly as well. 

The issue that escalated the unrest to a climax -- which the board finally had to acknowledge -- was the perceived indifference to racism on campus and the lack of action to combat it.

The fallout from that happened just as quickly. 

HilesA
“When we’re in National headline coverage, we’re getting emails and calls. A lot of confusion, anger and frustration expressed.”

Tom Hiles, the Vice Chancellor for Advancement, fielded a lot of concerns from alumni about the unrest. He reached out to Rod Kirsch, the senior vice president for Development and Alumni Relations at Penn State, who was on staff during the Jerry Sandusky debacle, if that tells you something about the magnitude and pace of the crisis … He was flown out to Columbia for a day. A crisis consultant was brought into the system for a week. 

The Marketing and Communication department headed by Interim Vice Chancellor Jennifer Hollingshead put out a 10 point state of Mizzou article seemingly meant to salvage the school’s image.

 Then, university system officials, including Hiles and Hollingshead, held a conference call with Missouri alumni who were in the communications industry to hear their thoughts on the state of mizzou article, a tv spot, editorials to newspapers, and the state of the university address. 1977 alum Ty Christian, who is black, was on the call. 

He says the alumni input seemed to fall on deaf ears.

Christian 25:13
“the first question we all asked in our own way was "wow okay. so i guess not bad but did you do any research? did you talk to the key stakeholders? and the find out their perspective and their insight and find out how they felt?" And of course the answer sort of kind of came back "no we haven't done it. this is what we think should go out." and i can say without hesitation you can hear the silence on the phone that the people who are in this profession and do it daily know that you don't create any piece or material without talking to you key stakeholders and taking their temperatures.” 

When Christian says stakeholders, he means alumni, students, donors, prospective students and parents. He says the literature put out by the marketing and commications department comes across as defensive with sections titled “it’s not just mizzou,” “we support civil liberties” and “personnel matters are private.” 

He says it’s a PR piece of work too quicklyrashly churned out. 

Christian 1313
If I'm a paying customer enough is enough. And listen I'm not very happy with your service, you need to do something about it.

The university business type administrators view the students at customers.

Sara Goldrick Rab is a professor of educational policy studies at the University of Wisconsin Madison. She says students have increasingly been viewed as consumers, hence why we are seeing more business managers as candidates to run schools.

Goldrick 700
students are very much not consumers in the classic sense, they are not purchasing something that is discreet and can be sort of bought and sold in an easy fashion. It means different things to different people, what education is. And it would kind of be like buying love, buying and selling love, it is not a tangible product and it again comes about in different ways for different people and means different things but we all know it’s valuable. 

On the flip side, students today are starting to understand how they fit into this business education model, suggesting ‘hey, two can play that game.’ 

Goldrick 1120
This means that this group of students is more likely to question the system to ask why things are happening, to object to the con ditions of their lives. And so, I think the fact is that we’ve seen increases in enrollment among people whose parents didn’t go to college, among people from ethnic and racial minority groups and from people from low income families and it’s quite possible that adding them to the dynamic of a college campus helps to generate this change that we’re seeing today.

This is a big issue to consider when the latest board of curators start the hiring process for Wolfe’s replacement. The curators have to answer: How do you balance the economic needs of a university system with the academic and development needs of its students.

Current chair of the board Pamela Hendrickson


Pam 9:46
Currently, it’s brave new world. And President Middleton has brought to the fall how different the students’ experiences on campus today, wherever, and all over the country, all are those we experience when we went to college. And even from what my children’s experienced, when they went through colleges. And we need to be more attuned (10:20) to that, and to the way the students see the world. 


So far the curators have talked openly about considering academic candidates and they’ve also added student and faculty voting positions to the hiring committee. 

But there is clearly a race issue s that the university president will need to address that a business leader may not be as equipped for . 



B:Ultimately, the UM system clearly has management problems, an image problem with its stakeholders including state legislators, and an inclusivity problem with its students on campus. 

Indeed, the state of the university address, which was meant to be a shift to refocus on more positive points of pride for the school, was overshadowed. Tom Hiles.

HilesB
“Unfortunately on the week of that state of university address, on Monday, Melissa click, she was charged with misdemeanor assault. Maty Mauk got kicked off the football team. And then Tim Wolf’es email came out. That was a little challenging on a week we were trying to pivot.

Whoever is hired as president is going to have to spearhead the racial and social issues the campus has been dealing with. Ty Christian again.

Christian 915
The university of Missouri, like most institutions, always had obviously racial tension, racial distress, but for the most part nobody talked about it. If you were a kid of color who went to university of Missouri, you sort of tolerated it just to get your degree and you got out of there and you went back to your given city or your given hometown and moved on with your career. 

Christian says this is a pivotal time for the school to respond not hastily but powerfully.

This is a moment for Mizzou to be courageous and by being courageous bold and innovative, without hesitation, we will be a leading university and a thought leader where people will be coming to us and saying hey how did you overcome those issues you had, because not only did you rebound, but you're bigger better and bolder than you were before.

I’m Kristofor Husted. And I’m Bram Sable-Smith

Coming up in part three of our series, we look at how the Columbia campus plan to address many of the issues brought to the forefront last semester. And they’ll discuss what is even achievable when it comes to addressing issues of race. 

4:20 How much can we change? Tremendous. We all can. We all can. There is room for change on every level, from administration, to students to faculty to staff, we all don’t know everything, we’re all goring, and that’s what culture is, culture evolves and culture is evolving here at Mizzou.
