Intro: From the KBIA Newsroom in Columbia, I’m Ryan Famuliner, and this is part 2 of our special series: Mizzou at a Crossroads. 
Yesterday, you heard about the complicated racial history of the University of Missouri, including the events that eventually led to the resignation of former University of Missouri system president Tim Wolfe. You heard Marshall Allen, a member of Concerned Student 1-9-5-0, explain why the group targeted Wolfe.

because we knew we had to make a head change as far as our campus… We figured that getting him out or making sure that we got him to resign was one of the first steps in making sure that we had change. Because if the change starts at the top than the bottom has to follow.

Today we’re talking about how Wolfe became the focal point of those protests from the perspective of the people who hired him, and with t            

Kristofor Husted and Bram Sable-Smith report. 

Most timelines of the events that led to the November 9th resignation of former UM system president Tim Wolfe start here, at the 2015 homecoming parade, when the  group Concerned Student 1950 stopped Wolfe’s car and recited a history of racism in Missouri and on the Mizzou campus. 

Act :35
This is not an indictment on white folk but it is an indictment on white structures and white supremacy. 

In 1839, the University of Missouri was established as a flagship institution west of the Mississippi river. this institution was for white men only. only white men. And was built on the back of black people, let me repeat that. let me repeat that. 

Wolfe received criticism for not speaking with the students, and many believe that perceived slight made Wolfe a target.

Act
Jim: It came to a head during MU’s Homecoming parade. Student’s are concerned about the UM president’s perceived passive attitude on Racism. Good evening I’m Jim reik,
Bri ttany: And I’m Brittany Pieper. Today one of those students began a hunger strike and says he’ll continue until president Tim Wolfe is no longer in office. 

The pressure continued to mount.
Act
Tim: I will give you an answer and I’m sure it will be a wrong answer. Systematic oppression is because you don’t believe you have the equal opportunity 
Crowd: You don't believe!!??
Did you just blame us for systematic oppression, Tim Wolfe? Did you just blame black students?

Until finally...

BUILDING PROTEST NATS ON D DAY THEN STOP

But to understand how Tim Wolfe, the president of the entire university system ended up with his head in the guillotine, we have to take it back much earlier to when he was hired.

MUSIC INDICATING GOING BACK/RESETTING 

We spoke to seven of the curators who played some role in the hiring process of Tim Wolfe:  in the beginning, the end, or all the way through.  From those conversations, a few common themes emerged.   The first:it is impossible to talk about Tim Wolfe’s hiring without first mentioning his predecessor: Gary Forsee

Craig [3ish]
The feedback that the curators received from the 4 campuses was, ‘see if you can find somebody just like Gary Forsee because we really like him, and we really like his background. 

That’s former curator Craig Van Matre. Gary Forsee’s background came up a lot in our conversations. And it came up because it was so unusual at the time.

Downing [8:30ish
he was not your prototype of what historically had been viewed as president of a university system. 

Don Downing is another former curator.

Don [:45ish]
Gary came from a business background, he was CEO of Sprint.

Before Gary Forsee became president of the University system, he was president and CEO of Sprint Nextel, before that, he worked for BellSouth, a telecommunications corporation, and for Cingular wireless, and for Global one, and for AT&T. In short, while he had a lot of experience, none of it was in higher education. And back in 2007, hiring a business person to run an academic institution was not as common of a practice.

But some of the most pressing matters facing the University at the time of Forsee’s tenure were not inherently academic. Especially one: state funding. Beginning in about 2002, state appropriations for the University of Missouri system began to dip.

Don [1:32]
We saw state funding for the university of system decline from 498 million in 2010, to 438 million in 2011, to 398 million in 2012 which is a decline of about a hundred million dollars in a three year period.

On just the Columbia campus, student enrollment grew by 45%  between 2001 and 2012,  In that same time period, state funding to the University dropped by 14 percent, from 193 million dollars down to 166 million. 

There are only a few ways to make up that difference in funding. Tuition is one of them. Here’s David Wasinger, a curator when Forsee was hired.

Wasinger 3:30 
Tuition had gone too high and we wanted to, at least I wanted, someone to monitor and make the university more efficient. A lot of the administrators and a lot of the faculty have an insatiable appetite for spending.

To the curators at the time, Gary Forsee’s business background made him sort of an ideal fit for the tough financial times facing the university system. Not everyone saw his hire in the same light, though, including Gary Ebersole, a University of Missouri kansas city  professor and member of the UM system’s intercampus faculty council. 

Ebersol 1:30ish
The hiring of Gary Forsee was a kind of out of the box move by the board of trustees who decided they wanted a businessman. Faculty were not really involved not in the search itself and not enthused by the idea of a businessman. 

Forsee’s tenure was not without its hiccups, but over time he seemed to win over many stakeholders including the faculty. Even Ebersole agreed the arrangement seemed to work out. 

Ebersole
But once he was on board it took a while for him to adjust to the culture of the university, but eventually we worked quite well together. 

The curators, including Wayne Goode who joined the board in 2009, also were encouraged with the direction Forsee’s tenure was taking

Wayne [1:30ish
Gary was in the process of tightening up management systems and I think doing a pretty good job of it. 

In January 2011, less than three years into his tenure, , Forsee resigned following his wife’s cancer diagnosis. And Don downing says the perceived success of Forsee’s tenure opened the field of possibilities in the search for his successor. 

Actually it may have been more than that. Although every curator we spoke to said they considered all types of candidates, by most accounts, given the continued financial constraints on the University system, most curators  thought it made sense to replace Forsee with another person with a business background. Here’s former curator Craig Van Matre. 

Craig [3:15
We think his background is more important in selecting a successor as a model than finding somebody who came up through academia, because the primary functions of the president are of a business and political nature. He or she interfaces with the state legislature, concerns himself or herself with finances, ‘how are you going to pay for all the enormous physical plan and all this huge salary outlay that is required by the university. 

Downing [2:50
We have a 4 campus system, and then we have each of the 4 campuses which is governed by it’s own chancellor.

Don Downing.

Don
I think the board was comfortable at the time - as long as the chancellors of each of the campuses had an academic background, and had the respect of the faculty on each of the campuses, the president of the system first and foremost needed to be a manager of scarce resources and find ways to be more efficient with the resources and the ever decreasing resources that we were receiving. 

Wasinger 2:50
It is a very large enterprise and the board thought the most appropriate person to run an enterprise like that would be someone with business experience.

David Wasinger.

Wasinger 420
There were faculty productivity issues that could be addressed. There were courses that were outdated or superfluous.

LAYERED MONTAGE OF CURATORS SAYING “BUSINESS” AND  “MANAGEMENT” BUILDING TO WHITE NOISE. OR MUSICAL INTERLUDE SUGGESTING SHIFT

The curators had a clear picture of the type of person they wanted for president - someone who would continue the down the path Forsee had started. But, outside the board, not every stakeholder shared in that same opinion, especially the faculty, including Gary Ebersole.

Ebersole 2:55
I have to say that what the faculty were looking for was considered irrelevant by the board of curators especially the chair at the time, who decided they wanted somebody just like Gary Forsee. There was a faculty committee that was established as advisory to the board, but from all reports from my faculty and other faculty in the system that committee never met, never was asked for its advice. 

And by this time, this type of hire with a business background seemed to be becoming popular nationally.

Bastedo 405
It definitely seems to be more common that trustees are looking for a president with a business-type background. 

Michael Bastedo is a professor at the University of Michigan specializing in higher education. 

Bastedo 520
By nature they see business people and politicians as leaders and so they have a natural inclination and their own network they’re connected to people in those spheres when they start thinking about leadership positions. 

But just because curators decide they’re looking for someone with a business or political background to run an academic institution, doesn’t make it an easy task to accomplish. Wasinger.

Wasinger 810 
It’s very difficult to attract a business person from the private business sector to take the position  of the president of the university of missouri.

He says the complexity of running a university system isn’t always attractive to a business person.

Wasinger 6:03
The problem in identifying and finding a business person to run that University of Missouri system is a lack of candidates for the position because a lot of people who are successful in the business sector, want to stay in the sector.

The board hired Florida-based search firm Greenwood/Asher & Associates  to track down a pool of candidates to replace Forsee. But by most accounts, the board wasn’t satisfied with the names they saw on the list. So, the board also recruited candidates through other lines, like the business school alumni network - which is how Tim Wolfe’s name came to the applicant pool. David Bradley was a curator at the time.

Bradley 6:20
we thought he was a guy that we had to go after to get him to take this job. He was not looking for a job at the time. He had just gone through a long period and built up a large international company. And he was not looking for this job at the time. So we had to do some things to attract him to get him in this type of business, which is not something he had a background in but we thought he could do a great job

The curators courted Wolfe, trying to entice him to come back to his alma mater. And almost every curator we spoke with said Tim is... just a really good guy. Van Matre.

Van Matre [9:30
Tim Wolfe is an outstanding individual. He has a very good personality, He is a good speaker, he is intelligent and quick but he doesn’t have the kind of personality characteristics that are off putting. He has two parents who were PhDs and professors at the University so he grew up with an academic background in effect in Columbia, Missouri.

Forme curator Wayne Goode.

Goode 823
We were impressed with what he had done. We were impressed with his demeanor I guess you could use, personality, maybe more demeanor, and how his thought process seemed to work and his views on management. 

Warren Erdman who was chair of the board of curators during the hiring process.

Erdman [7:13
Well, I think Tim has the kind of personality you want in a president. Someone who is comfortable being with people. Someone who is approachable, open minded, a good listener. He had all of those attributes, plus he had the business acumen that you want in a CEO and can lead a large institution.  He grew up in an academic family. He had a strong appreciation for the academic traditions of the University of Missouri. He attended the University of Missouri. He was a graduate of the University of Missouri and an alumnus of the University of Missouri. So he seemed to have all of the things that our candidate profile, which had been generated by constituents and stakeholders. He seemed to have all of those qualities. 

Wolfe got the job and things started okay. He was a good ol boy who graduated from Mizzou. When the University came under scrutiny for their shortcomings related to Title IX issues, they were addressed quickly.. And... 

Don Downing [12:10ish]
Tim hired Hank Foley from Penn State, and during Hank’s time at Penn State he was one of the leaders in the country at obtaining federal grants for research and development. And Hank made some strides at our university, as well as you probably know, Hank is now the chancellor at the campus.

But the tide began to shift after a few unpopular decisions and a lack of response to major issues which would incite the anger of not just faculty and students, but legislators and the general public. 

Wasinger 949
I know and like Tim Wolfe. I think he’s a good person. Tim probably could have gotten out in front of some issues better than he did. 

MUSIC SHIFT
     
University of Missouri Kansas City professor Gary Ebersole  says Wolfe’s first misstep  was in 2012, deciding to close the University operated publishing house: the University of Missouri press. 

Ebersole 7:30ish
He came into the office, looks over budgets and sees that the university press was in the red. And he very quickly said we’re not going to keep a university press that’s in the red, without understanding that there is not a single university press in the country that makes money. In other words, universities subsidize the presses because it is an absolutely essential part of the investment in education that knowledge be distributed and disseminated to the world really.

It wasn’t a bad decision from  an economic perspective, but it was missing a certain nuance and deliberation that comes with decision making in the academic world.  Shuttering the Missouri Press would have impacted publishers across the country. And Don Downing says Wolfe became aware of that. 

Don Downing 14:34 
There are certain things in the academic world that are different than the business world. So yeah i think tim would be the first to say that he made some mistakes and learned from those.

Ultimately Wolfe reversed this decision. But critics point to other decisions too like the expansion of sports facilities, and over attentiveness to large donors at the expense of academic affairs - the institution’s bread and butter. 

But to many of the curators, Wolfe’s biggest misstep may have been the hiring of R. Bowen Loftin as chancellor of the flagship campus in 2013. Wayne Goode.

Goode1345
I would say that that hire of Bowen and his performance is one of the most disappointing experiences that I've been part of.
 
Loftin, who previously was president at Texas A&M University, says he was hired by Wolfe to shake things up.

Lofitn :28
The curators and president Wolfe both told me I was to be an agent of change 

Loftin moved swiftly as chancellor. He held the position for not even two years, but in that time he rocked the Columbia campus boat. 

Under Loftin, 110 faculty and 13 administrators accepted early retirement, reportedly saving the university millions. 

Loftin 15ish
To be able to get about 10% of our senior tenured faculty to retire in one year, that's an extraordinary thing. To   free up the resources required to renew our faculty in a very short period of time. that's a very rare thing for a campus to be able to do so, I’m very proud this university was able to do that. 

But last year, when student aid and benefits ended up on the chopping block, things got sloppy. The University announced it would cut Graduate student tuition waivers in half, then reversed the decision.  . 

Another snafu: health insurance subsidies for graduate students were dropped with only a one day heads up - a decision that Loftin himself reversed.

The damage was done though. Large student demonstrations popped up on campus in response to these missteps, with many faculty backing them.

Wayne Goode.

Goode 2010
Bowen would grab these situations and go through a process without including a whole lot of people -- maybe no one else -- and making decisions. I didn't see that coming.

And there were other high profiles decisions -  cutting the vice chancellor for health affairs position, revoking hospital privileges for a planned parenthood doctor, even the resignation of the dean of the medical school was attributed to Loftin. 

Goode 2030
But on these three or four problems that he had, the medical school, the planned parenthood, the others, he just went in and made his decisions that he didn't discuss with others and you can't run a campus that way. 

All of these decisions drew backlash, from students, from faculty, even administrators - and most of it was directed at Loftin. But, Loftin says in every case, he was consulting with Tim Wolfe. 

Loftin 1:20     [Loftin talking about Wolfe]
I shared with him everything i knew here on campus that i felt was relevant. And every major decision I made was discussed with him before i made it so we had a very strong relationship I thought . Back in August of last year i had my second annual evaluation, in september sent me a letter giving me praise for my work and also indicating financial rewards along with that. So I felt - this was september of 2015 - i felt we were on good terms at that point.

    rTim Wolfe did not respond to our multiple requests for an interview. But in a now infamous email published first in the Columbia Daily Tribune in January, Wolfe alluded to those decisions made by Loftin, adding that all of the Deans on the Missouri campus had called for Loftin’s ouster   and that Wolfe himself had requested support from the board of curators to fire Loftin. 

David Bradley.

Bradley 11:53
Hiring people is not a hundred percent, excuse me I’m in a waiting room of a hospital, I just had a grandbaby, so that’s why you have all that noise in the background. It’s not an error free task, and so anyway you never bat a thousand in hiring people, and apparently with bowen loftin it didn’t work out as a great fit for the university and it’s unfortunate, but it’s an unfortunate part of the deal. I’ll take some responsibility as a curator. All of the curators approved bowen loftin on Tim’s recommendation. 

And this was the environment,  even before Wolfe’s confrontation with Concerned student 1950  at homecoming:  tension, not just about race, but about university funding, top-down decision making, all of it part of the struggle to  move the University forward into the realities of the 21st century.

BUILD IN MUSIC STARTING HERE

Anger and tension brewed in the university of missouri system. Many students were upset that administrators didn’t respond strongly when the student body President was called the “n word” off campus in September. 

Then, on October 5th, students in the Legion of Black Collegians were called the n word on campus. Loftin came out strongly , releasing a video condemning the incident.

FADE UP ACT
It’s happened again. Just last night on Traditions Plaza, hate and racism were alive and well at Mizzou. The LBC royalty court was in the middle of preparing for their event when someone, one of us, went and called them racial slurs and showed how much hate they have in their hearts. 

It’s enough, let's stop this. Let’s end hatred and racism at Mizzou. We’re part of the same family, you don’t hate your family. You don’t call your family those kinds of names. FADE UNDER Join with me and everyone else who is truly part of this family and say enough is enough and stop it now. 

PROTEST CHANTING AGAIN…

Emotions boiled over. It was just a few days later that Concerned Student 1950 stopped Tim Wolfe’s car at Homecoming.  

The group issued a list of demands  as Wolfe was slow to acknowledge the racial issues even after the homecoming demonstration. One of the demands was for Wolfe to be removed as President.

1950 member Jonathan Butler began a hunger strike, saying it would only end when Wolfe was out as President.

The football team backed the protesters, boycotting practice and games until Butler could eat again - until Wolfe was gone. 

Grad students joined in. r
Faculty came out in support.

 November 9th. The university system had reached it’s breaking point. 

NEWS BITE ACT ON WOLFE MAKING ANNOUNCEMENT
ACT from KOMU
Just minutes into this mornings curators meeting UM systems president Tim Wolfe approached the podium and immediately announced his resignation.

SNIPPET OF WOLFE’S RESIGNATION SPEECH

The protesters were ecstatic. But, as Craig Van Matre explains, the people who hired Wolfe were not. 

Van Matre 26ish
And then when Wolfe did the only thing that he could do and resigned, then they had this symbolic head on this symbolic stick and not one thing of any practical value came out of it from there on. Very disappointing very disappointing all the way around. 

For many of the curators who hired Wolfe, the issue of racism on the Mizzou campus was exactly that.

David Bradley

Bradley 13:33
That was a campus level issue, it should have been handled at the campus level, and when it wasn’t handled at the campus level, I thought it was unfortunate that Tim fell on the sword for this issue.

Wayne Goode.

Goode 2500
I for one wish he wouldn't have resigned. I talked to him about it at the time.

Warren Erdman

Erdman 13:03
I’m very sorry that happened, but that doesn’t change the fact that Tim Wolfe was an excellent leader for the University of Missouri system during his presidency    

David Wasinger

Wasinger 13:45
Now we have the remnants of a head football coach and some self-described radicals who have been running, or the perception that they have been running, the University of Missouri, and you cannot have that. 

In his confidential letter to friends that was later made public Wolfe said he was concerned about campus safety and the escalation of protests turning into something historically embarrassing for the University of Missouri. Craig Van Matre agreed.

Van Matre 27ish
Did Wolfe do the right thing  by tendering his resignation? absolutely. Had he not i don't think the curators ever would have fired him. Matter of fact [chuckles] if it were possible, which i don't know if it is or not, I wish i wish he'd reapply for the job so we could rehire him. It’d make a lot more sense to re hire him than spend the thousands and thousands of dollars and thousands of horus that it takes finding his replacement.

FALLOUT

Much like the decisions that rattled the Columbia campus in the past couple years - graduate student health subsidies, refer and follow privileges for the planned parenthood doctor, the med school dean - the resignations of Wolfe and Loftin happened rapidly as well. 

The issue that escalated the unrest to a climax -- which the board finally had to acknowledge -- was the perceived indifference to racism on campus and the lack of action to combat it.

The fallout from that happened just as quickly. 

HilesA
“When we’re in National headline coverage, we’re getting emails and calls. A lot of confusion, anger and frustration expressed.”

Tom Hiles, the Vice Chancellor for Advancement, fielded a lot of concerns from alumni about the unrest. He reached out to Rod Kirsch, the senior vice president for Development and Alumni Relations at Penn State, who was on staff during the Jerry Sandusky debacle, if that tells you something about the magnitude and pace of the crisis …  He was flown out to Columbia for a day.  A crisis consultant was brought into the system for a week. 

The Marketing and Communication department headed by Interim Vice Chancellor Jennifer Hollingshead put out a 10 point state of Mizzou article seemingly meant to salvage the school’s image.

 Then, university system officials, including Hiles and Hollingshead, held a conference call with Missouri alumni who were in the communications industry to hear their thoughts on the state of mizzou article, a tv spot, editorials to newspapers, and the state of the university address. 1977 alum Ty Christian, who is black, was on the call. 

He says the alumni input seemed to fall on deaf ears.

Christian 25:13
“the first question we all asked in our own way was "wow okay. so i guess not bad but did you do any research? did you talk to the key stakeholders? and the find out their perspective and their insight and find out how they felt?" And of course the answer sort of kind of came back "no we haven't done it. this is what we think should go out." and i can say without hesitation you can hear the silence on the phone that the people who are in this profession and do it daily know that you don't create any piece or material without talking to you key stakeholders and taking their temperatures.” 

When Christian says stakeholders, he means alumni, students, donors, prospective students and parents. He says the literature put out by the marketing and commications department comes across as defensive with sections titled “it’s not just mizzou,” “we support civil liberties”  and “personnel matters are private.” 

He says it’s a  PR piece of work too quicklyrashly churned out. 

Christian 1313
If I'm a paying customer enough is enough. And listen I'm not very happy with your service, you need to do something about it.

Goldrick620
The university business type administrators view the students at customers.

Sara Goldrick Rab is a professor of educational policy studies at the University of Wisconsin Madison. She says students have increasingly been viewed as consumers, hence why we are seeing more business managers as candidates to run schools.

Goldrick 700
students are very much not consumers in the classic sense, they are not purchasing something that is discreet and can be sort of bought and sold in an easy fashion. It means different things to different people, what education is. And it would kind of be like buying love, buying and selling love, it is not a tangible product and it again comes about in different ways for different people and means different things but we all know it’s valuable. 

On the flip side, students today are starting to understand how they fit into this business education model, suggesting ‘hey, two can play that game.’ 

Goldrick 1120
This means that this group of students is more likely to question the system to ask why things are happening, to object to the con ditions of their lives. And so, I think the fact is that we’ve seen increases in enrollment among people whose parents didn’t go to college, among people from ethnic and racial minority groups and from people from low income families and it’s quite possible that adding them to the dynamic of a college campus helps to generate this change that we’re seeing today.

This is a big issue to consider when the latest board of curators start the hiring process for Wolfe’s replacement. The curators have to answer: How do you balance the economic needs of a university system with the academic and development needs of its students.

Current chair of the board Pamela Hendrickson


Pam 9:46
Currently, it’s brave new world. And President Middleton has brought to the fall how different the students’ experiences on campus today, wherever, and all over the country, all are those we experience when we went to college. And even from what my children’s experienced, when they went through colleges. And we need to be more attuned (10:20) to that, and to the way the students see the world.  


So far the curators have talked openly about considering academic candidates and they’ve also added student and faculty voting positions to the hiring committee. 

But there is clearly a race issue s that the university president will need to address that  a business leader may not be as equipped for . 



B:Ultimately, the UM system clearly has management problems, an image problem with its stakeholders including state legislators, and an inclusivity problem with its students on campus. 

Indeed, the state of the university address, which was meant to be a shift to refocus on more positive points of pride for the school, was overshadowed. Tom Hiles.

HilesB
“Unfortunately on the week of that state of university address, on Monday, Melissa click, she was charged with misdemeanor assault. Maty Mauk got kicked off the football team. And then Tim Wolf’es email came out. That was a little challenging on a week we were trying to pivot.

Whoever is hired as president is going to have to spearhead the racial and social issues the campus has been dealing with. Ty Christian again.

Christian 915
The university of Missouri, like most institutions, always had obviously racial tension, racial distress, but for the most part nobody talked about it. If you were a kid of color who went to university of Missouri, you sort of tolerated it just to get your degree and you got out of there and you went back to your given city or your given hometown and moved on with your career. 

Christian says this is a pivotal time for the school to respond not hastily but powerfully.

(BUILD OUTRO MUSIC HALFWAY THROUGH)

Christian 3700
This is a moment for Mizzou to be courageous and by being courageous bold and innovative, without hesitation, we will be a leading university and a thought leader where people will be coming to us and saying hey how did you overcome those issues you had, because not only did you rebound, but you're bigger better and bolder than you were before.

I’m Kristofor Husted. And I’m Bram Sable-Smith
###

Coming up in part three of our series, we look at how the Columbia campus plan to address many of the issues brought to the forefront last semester. And they’ll discuss what is even achievable when it comes to addressing issues of race.  

4:20 How much can we change? Tremendous. We all can. We all can. There is room for change on every level, from administration, to students to faculty to staff, we all don’t know everything, we’re all goring, and that’s what culture is, culture evolves and culture is evolving here at Mizzou.

Tune in tomorrow at 6 _ for the third and final piece of the series “Mizzou at a Crossroads” on KBIA. And visit KBIA.org to find part 1.
